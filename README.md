# repo-Necromagus
Originally called Necromagus, Redead is a student project that was developed over +/-6 weeks during our 3rd year at Dawson College. 
It is a 2D platformer game where dying is key. 
The player must die repeatedly in order to properly progress through the game. 
Navigate through the ruins by solving puzzles and reaching checkpoints that hold a letter to incantation, which are key to breaking the curse of a never ending death.
